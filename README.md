A Kwon and Gunn production.

# Hello!
This is a small open source voice trainer, primarily geared towards trans people.

## Goals

There are three high level goals this app is going to try to hit:

1) A way to extract voices from youtube clips or otherwise to both analyze and try to get one's voice closer to them.
2) Handy data on resonance and pitch.
3) A clearer success metric on exercises. The idea is to incorporate the exercises and provide some clear grading on how the person did/is doing.

## Work Philosophy of this open source project
This is mostly to have fun and provide another resource!

There's already (frankly) quite a large number, but ... may as well!
As a consequence, this project is going to be pretty lackadaisical.
